Rule.cs: Defines the structure of a rule, including conditions and actions.Condition.cs: Represents a condition within a rule that must be evaluated.Action.cs: Specifies the action to be executed when conditions are met.RuleEngine.cs: Contains the logic to evaluate rules against provided data.Workflow.cs: Manages the sequence in which rules are evaluated and actions are executed.rules.json: A JSON file that stores the rules to be loaded into the engine.Program.cs: The entry point of the application, demonstrating how to use the rule engine.This structure allows for defining business rules externally in a JSON file, which the engine can then load and evaluate. This approach facilitates easy updates to business logic without modifying the core application code.If you have specific questions or need assistance with particular aspects of this rule engine, feel free to ask!
